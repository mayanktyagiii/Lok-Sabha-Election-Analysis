# Lok-Sabha-Election-Analysis
This is a Lok Sabha Election Analysis project! The goal here is to gather data from the Election Commission of India's official results portal (https://results.eci.gov.in) and perform an insightful analysis based on the collected data.

## Technologies Used üñ•Ô∏è

The following technologies were utilized for this project:
- **Python**: Used for web scraping and data manipulation.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis tool in Python.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for data analysis.
- **Tableau**: Software for generating Dashboards and visualization.

## Data Scraping üíΩ

To collect data from the ECI website, a Python script (`scraping_script.py`) was developed using BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML pages. The script navigates through the website, extracts relevant election results data, and stores it for further analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Visualization üìä

To Visualize data from the python script, the scraped data was converted to a CSV file . Then the csv file was cleaned using MsExcel and finally used to generate insightful Dashboard using Tableau Public.

## Conclusion üßê

In conclusion, this project offers a comprehensive analysis of the recent Lok Sabha election data, highlighting significant trends and patterns in voter behavior, political dynamics, and electoral outcomes.
